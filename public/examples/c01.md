# Hello World
You can use the guide on the right to explain the purpose of the challenge.

You can write any valid markdown; see the reference [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

This could include code snippets as well

```py
print("hello world")
```


Once ready, press the `Debug` button on the top. To reset the challenge, press the `reset` button. You can also change the theme of the editor, or pick a different challenge.

## Answer checking
Pressing the submit button checks whether the answer satisfies the test cases as specified in the json file. E.g.
```json
"tests": [
  {
    "in": "",
    "out": "hello world"
  }
]
```

The out string accepts `\n` for new lines. For ease of use it ignores any extra blank new lines at the end of the string (e.g. this challenge actually prints `hello world\n`).

## Solution display

You can add a solution by adding the hasSolution setting to the challenge json. This will automatically create a new solutions file to add your solution code. By default it will not be shown unless you set showSolution to true.

```json
"hasSolution": true,
"showSolution": true
```

If you don't want the solution shown immediately (until thought has occurred), you can also set showSolution to be a number which means that the solution will display after the user has interacted with the Debug button at least that number of times!

```json
"hasSolution": true,
"showSolution": 5
```
