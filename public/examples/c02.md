# Hello name

You can use the guide on the right to explain the purpose of the challenge.

You can write any valid markdown; see the reference [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

Once ready, press the `Debug` button on the top. To reset the challenge, press the `reset` button. You can also change the theme of the editor, or pick a different challenge.

You can now also test your answer using the `check it` button.

Note that by default test cases are shown to the user when an incorrect submission is made. This is generally recommended to avoid user frustration when fixing their code! However to hide the input and expected output of any particular test-case from the user you can set an optional `reveal` attribute to `false` which is done on each test-case as shown:

```
"tests": [
  { "in": "Joe", "out": ".*Hello Joe", "reveal": false },
  { "in": "Alice", "out": ".*Hello Alice", "reveal": false }
]
```
