# Turtle example

Facilitates most basic python turtle instructions for pen, fill, colors and position control.

Does not implement all turtle functionality including reading the state of the turtle.

You can control the screen size (which is default 500 by 400) using

```
import turtle
NEW_WIDTH = 800
NEW_HEIGHT = 500
sc = turtle.Screen()
sc.setup(NEW_WIDTH, NEW_HEIGHT)
```
